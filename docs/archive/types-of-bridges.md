# Types of blockchain bridges

Not all bridges work the same way, and understanding the differences can help you determine which one best suits your needs:

* `Trust-based Bridges`: These are operated by a centralized entity, requiring users to trust that entity to manage and safeguard their assets. While these bridges can offer faster and more straightforward operations, they introduce a single point of failure, as the security of the entire system depends on the integrity of the operator.
* `Decentralized Bridges`: These rely on smart contracts and a distributed group of validators to ensure smooth and secure operations without needing a central authority. Although they avoid centralization issues, they can sometimes be slower or more costly due to the additional security checks involved.
* `Hybrid Bridges`: Hybrid bridges combine elements of both trusted and decentralized models, using centralized intermediaries alongside decentralized smart contracts or consensus systems. This approach aims to balance efficiency and security, providing a flexible solution for cross-chain asset transfers.
* `Two-way Bridges`: Bi-directional bridges enable the transfer of assets in both directions between two blockchains, making it easy to move your tokens in either direction.
* `One-way Bridges`: As the name suggests, these bridges allow the transfer of assets from one blockchain to another but do not support transfers in the opposite direction. Theyâ€™re useful in cases where you only need to transfer tokens once, such as when moving assets to a chain where they will remain and be used.
