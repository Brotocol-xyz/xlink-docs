# What is Brotocol?

Brotocol Bridge is a MPC-based hybrid bi-directional bridge that acts as a 'connector' between Bitcoin and other blockchains, enabling seamless asset transfers and swaps between Bitcoin and its Layer 2 networks (L2s) as well as other blockchain ecosystems.&#x20;

**Brotocol currently offers two key features:**

* [BroBridge](features/broswap/)
* [BroSwap](features/broswap/)

## Key Features

* **Bi-Directional Asset Transfers**: Easily transfer assets between Bitcoin and L2s, as well as non-Bitcoin chains.
* **Secure and Decentralized**: Utilizes multisigs and decentralized validators to secure all transfers.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to provide a smooth experience for both novice and experienced users.
* **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Supports multiple blockchains including Bitcoin, Stacks, and EVM-compatible chains.

Brotocol plays a crucial role in projects building on Bitcoin, offering a 'native-like' DeFi experience by enabling users to interact with smart contracts on L2s using native BTC or other Bitcoin L1 assets.

## Types of blockchain bridges

Not all bridges work the same way, and understanding the differences can help you determine which one best suits your needs:

* `Trust-based Bridges`: These are operated by a centralized entity, requiring users to trust that entity to manage and safeguard their assets. While these bridges can offer faster and more straightforward operations, they introduce a single point of failure, as the security of the entire system depends on the integrity of the operator.
* `Decentralized Bridges`: These rely on smart contracts and a distributed group of validators to ensure smooth and secure operations without needing a central authority. Although they avoid centralization issues, they can sometimes be slower or more costly due to the additional security checks involved.
* `Hybrid Bridges`: Hybrid bridges combine elements of both trusted and decentralized models, using centralized intermediaries alongside decentralized smart contracts or consensus systems. This approach aims to balance efficiency and security, providing a flexible solution for cross-chain asset transfers.
* `Two-way Bridges`: Bi-directional bridges enable the transfer of assets in both directions between two blockchains, making it easy to move your tokens in either direction.
* `One-way Bridges`: As the name suggests, these bridges allow the transfer of assets from one blockchain to another but do not support transfers in the opposite direction. Theyâ€™re useful in cases where you only need to transfer tokens once, such as when moving assets to a chain where they will remain and be used.

Brotocol's type is **`Two-way Bridges` .**&#x20;
