# How to Swap

{% hint style="info" %}
Be sure to [connect your wallet first](../../getting-started/how-to-connect-your-wallet.md) before using BroSwap!
{% endhint %}

### Step 1: Select the Asset You'd Like to Swap From

BroSwap currently supports up to three different networks to swap to and from:

* Bitcoin
* BRC-20
* Runes

To start, click on the Asset Selection A (The first option) as shown in the screenshot above) to pick the asset you want to swap from.

### Step 2: Select the Asset You'd Like to Swap To

After you have selected the asset you want to swap from, click on the Asset Selection (The second option) as shown in the screenshot above) to pick the asset you want to want to swap to.

### Step 3: Choose the Token you want to Swap From / To

In the Asset Selection pop-up (as shown in the screenshot above), youâ€™ll notice a â€˜<mark style="color:orange;">**â®‚ â‚¿**</mark>â€™ symbol next to certain assets.

This indicates that the asset is available for swapping. In our example, I have selected $BTC -> $aUSD; Native Bitcoin network to BRC-20's $aUSD.

If the symbol is not shown, that asset cannot be swapped to.

### Step 4: Checking the Rate, Network Fees, Slippages and Minimum Received

Once youâ€™ve selected the assets you want to swap from and to, you can enter the amount you'd like to swap.\
BroSwap will then display an estimate of what you'll receive based on your input.

On the same page, you can also adjust settings like **Network Fees**, **Slippage**, and **Route**.

{% hint style="success" %}
By default, BroSwap selects the most optimal route and network fee to ensure you get the best value for your swap!
{% endhint %}

### (Optional) Step 5: Double Check your Fee Estimates, Price Impact and Minimum Received

Before you click Swap, you can check the section below the Swap button to get a good idea on how much you would receive for the Swap.

**Important to note:** Our UI sets a default slippage of 4%, which may cause a slight difference between the _Minimum Received_ and the _Estimated_ amount shown. However, most transactions typically go through with less than 1% slippageâ€”for example, swaps like $BTC <> $aUSD.

### Step 6: Swap it!

Weâ€™ll show you the details from Step #5 again before you click **Confirm** to swap.

If you're not satisfied with the estimates, you can go back and adjust the slippage or network fee.

Once you're happy with the rate, click **Confirm** to proceed.

### Step 7: Approve the Transaction on your Wallet

On your walletâ€™s confirmation screen, youâ€™ll see the amount that will be spent for the bridge.

Depending on the wallet youâ€™re using, the estimated fees will also be displayed.

If everything looks good, go ahead and click **Confirm** to proceed.

### Step 8: All done! Just wait for your Swap to Complete!

Youâ€™ve successfully initiated your first swap! ðŸŽ‰

A pop-up will appear in the upper-right corner of your screen, letting you know thereâ€™s a pending transaction.

Youâ€™ll also notice the [**Explorer**](../explorer/) button changes to '**1 Pending'**, indicating an active swap is in progress.

If you clicked 'My Records only', you will be able to see your pending transactions and all you have to do now, is just wait until it's completed, that's all!
