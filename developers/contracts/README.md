# XLink Smart Contracts


XLink's core on-chain functionalities are contained in a series of contracts deployed on Stacks and EVM-compatible networks. Their main goal is to provide a bridging mechanism, allowing the movement of assets between Bitcoin and other blockchain ecosystems such as Stacks, Ethereum and Arbitrum (see complete list of chains [here](https://docs.brotocol.xyz/xlink-network/readme/ethereum-contract-addresses#table-of-contents)). Other XLink features include Bitcoin swaps, liquidity aggregation across chains, integration of staking protocols and the XLink Governance System.

The subsections below introduce the purpose, scope and interactions of the XLink contracts in Stacks and Ethereum, respectively. Within each subsection, you will find a detailed overview of each smart contract and its main variables, features, error codes and events.
