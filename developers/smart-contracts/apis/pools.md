## Fixed Weight Pool <a id="fixed-weight-pool"></a>

 Fixed weight pool is a tactical template which can be used as a reference for developers to use as a template on future works. Unlike Balancer or UniSwap, our weighted equation do allow dynamic weighting which depends on [Black & Scholes delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black–Scholes_model).

Collateral Rebalancing pool is a pool which users inject their collateral and mint ayToken\(against Token\) which represents the proportional ownership of the pool. Unlike Fixed weight pool, pools can be identified with 'token', 'collateral' and 'expiry', where by using weighted equation, it is possible to obtain a weight dynamically for the various operations in collateral rebalancing pool. Dynamic weighting in this context depends on [Black & Scholes delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black–Scholes_model). Collateral Rebalancing pool is mainly used by Borrower and Arbitrageurs.

Liquidity Bootstrapping pool is used for initializing all Yield Token Pools, which makes ayToken as a base token and Token to become a target Token. Detailed use cases and explanation can be ion our [White Paper](https://app.gitbook.com/@alexgo-io/s/docs/protocol/liquidity-bootstrapping-pool).
