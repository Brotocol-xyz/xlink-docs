# Using the Bridge

ALEX Bridge is available at [https://app.alexlab.co/bridge](https://app.alexlab.co/bridge).

## Fee

50bps is deducted from the source asset, floored at $2 for sUSDT => USDT, which goes towards covering the operational cost of the Bridge (including gas fee on both Ethereum and Stacks for the destination asset transfer). Any balances go to ALEX DAO Treasury.

## From USDT to sUSDT

You must have a valid Ethereum address, a valid Stacks address and connected to ALEX Bridge.

On the left, you can see the balance of USDT held at your wallet. Enter the amount of USDT you want to bridge over to Stacks, and, on the right, you will see the amount of sUSDT you will receive (net of [fees](using-the-bridge.md#fee)).

If you click on Details, you will see the details of the [fee](using-the-bridge.md#fee) and the time expected to take to bridge over USDT to sUSDT.

Clicking on Wrap, you can confirm the transfer on the familiar MetaMask pop-up window. Please note that once you confirm the transfer and the transaction confirmed, it is not reversible.

Once you complete these two steps, you can monitor the bridge transfer on the [Order History](using-the-bridge.md#order-history).

## From sUSDT to USDT

Just like from USDT to sUSDT, you must have a valid Ethereum address, a valid Stacks address and connected to ALEX Bridge.

On the left, you can see the balance of sUSDT held at your wallet. Enter the amount of sUSDT you want to bridge over to Ethereum, and, on the right, you will see the amount of USDT you will receive (net of [fees](using-the-bridge.md#fee)).

If you click on Details, you will see the details of the [fee](using-the-bridge.md#fee) and the time expected to take to bridge over sUSDT to USDT.

Clicking on Unwrap, you can confirm the details of the transfer (including your Ethereum address), following which you will confirm the transaction on the familiar Hiro (or Xverse) pop-up window. Please note that once you confirm the transfer and the transaction confirmed, it is not reversible.

Once you complete these two steps, you can monitor the bridge transfer on the [Order History](using-the-bridge.md#order-history).

## Order History

You can use Order History to monitor the current transfers as well as reviewing historical transfers. You will also find order hashes, which would be useful if you have issues with any of the orders and need to speak to the community managers for help.
