# How to Swap Non-Bridgeable Tokens

In some cases, certain tokens may not be supported by the XLink bridge due to compatibility limitations. If you encounter a token that cannot be bridged, you can still obtain the token you need by using **ALEX Swap**, a decentralized exchange that allows you to swap between various tokens easily.

## When to Use ALEX Swap

If you are attempting to bridge a token that is not compatible with the XLink bridge, it is recommended to use **ALEX Swap** to exchange it for a bridgeable token. This ensures that you can proceed with your cross-chain activities without interruption.

## Swap Tokens on ALEX Swap

To swap tokens on **ALEX Swap**, visit [**ALEX Swap**](https://app.alexlab.co/swap).

Once the swap is complete, you will have the token you need, and you can proceed to use the XLink bridge for cross-chain transfers.

## Example Use Case

Suppose you want to bridge a token that is not supported by XLink, such as **Token X**. By using **ALEX Swap**, you can swap **Token X** for a compatible token like **aBTC** or **USDT**. After the swap, you can then bridge the new token using the XLink platform.
