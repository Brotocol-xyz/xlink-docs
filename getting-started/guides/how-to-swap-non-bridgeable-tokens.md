# How to Swap Non-Bridgeable Tokens

In some cases, certain tokens may not be supported by the XLink bridge due to compatibility limitations. If you are attempting to bridge a token that is not compatible with the XLink bridge, it is recommended to use **ALEX Swap** to exchange it for a bridgeable token. This ensures that you can proceed with your cross-chain activities without interruption.

## Supported Tokens

Swap your tokens for tokens that can be bridged in XLink. You can find a list of supported tokens in our [**Overview section**](../../overview/supported-blockchains-and-tokens.md).

## Example Use Case

Letâ€™s say you have **USDA**, a token that is not bridgeable via XLink. In this case, you can use **ALEX Swap** to exchange **USDA** for **sUSDT**, which is compatible with the XLink bridge. After the swap, you can proceed with bridging **sUSDT** to another blockchain using XLink.
