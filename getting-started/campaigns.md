Participating in campaigns is easy and rewarding. Although each campaign might be slightly different, the basic steps to participate are similar:

### 2. **🌉 Bridge Your Assets**
   - Next, you’ll typically bridge assets from one blockchain to another. This could include tokens like aBTC, WBTC, or other supported assets.
   - Make sure to check the campaign’s instructions on which assets to bridge and to which chain.

### 3. **⚙️ Complete the Required Action**
   - Once your assets are bridged, you may need to perform additional actions like:
     - Re-staking your tokens.
     - Adding liquidity to a pool.
     - Borrowing or supplying tokens on a DeFi platform.
   - These actions unlock the campaign rewards!
