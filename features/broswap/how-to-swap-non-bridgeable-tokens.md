# How to swap Non-bridgeable Tokens?

In some cases, certain tokens may not be supported by the Brotocol bridge due to compatibility limitations. If you are attempting to bridge a token that is not compatible with the Brotocol bridge, it is recommended to use **ALEX Swap** to exchange it for a bridgeable token.&#x20;

This ensures that you can proceed with your cross-chain activities without interruption.

## Supported Tokens

Swap your tokens for tokens that can be bridged in Brotocol. You can find a list of supported tokens in our [**Overview section**](../../developers/supported-blockchains-and-tokens.md).

## Example Use Case

Letâ€™s say you have **USDh**, a token that is not bridgeable via Brotocol.&#x20;

In this case, you can use **ALEX Swap** to exchange **USDh** for **aUSD**, which is compatible with the Brobridge. After the swap, you can proceed with bridging **aUSD** to another blockchain using Brotocol.
