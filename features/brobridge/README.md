BroBridge is the best place to bridge from Bitcoin to any chains for lowest fees!

If you have not try BroBridge, try it now via here:  [https://brotocol.xyz/bridge/cross-bridge](https://brotocol.xyz/bridge/cross-bridge)

Follow these steps to bridge your assets between chains using Brotocol!

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** Users can only bridge tokens that represent the **same asset** across different blockchains. For example, BTC can be transferred to its equivalent, WBTC, when moving from Bitcoin to an EVM network, as both represent the same asset on different chains.
{% endhint %}

### Step 0: Connecting your Wallet

Before using the bridge, you need to connect a wallet for the blockchain you are bridging from, as well as one for the blockchain you are bridging to (e.g., **Stacks Chain**, **Bitcoin Chain**, or **EVM Chain**).

{% hint style="info" %}
See the [Prerequisites](../../introduction/getting-started/prerequisites/) section for the list of **Supported Wallets** and their installation guides.
{% endhint %}

You can connect your wallet by clicking the **Wallet Manager** located in the top right corner of the Brotocol app. This is where you’ll manage all your wallet connections.

In some cases, you can use the same wallet for both blockchains, but you must connect it separately for each blockchain to specify the source and destination accounts.

In this example, we will use [Xverse](https://www.xverse.app/), as it supports both the Bitcoin and Stacks networks. Since we are bridging from native BTC to Arbitrum's WBTC, we also need to connect an EVM wallet; in this example, we are using [Rabby Wallet](https://rabby.io/).

{% hint style="info" %}
For a detailed explanation on how to connect your wallet, check our guide: [**How to Connect your Wallet**](../../introduction/getting-started/prerequisites/how-to-connect-your-wallet.md).
{% endhint %}

Once you have connected both wallets, you will see them active in the **Wallet Manager**.

#### Step 1: Select the Source Blockchain and Token

To start, click on the '**From Asset Selection**'.

![To Token Selector](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-18 at 12.24.27 PM.png>)

Next, choose the **source blockchain** from which you want to bridge your assets (e.g., **Stacks Chain**).&#x20;

Then, select the **source token** you would like to bridge (e.g., **aUSD**).

{% hint style="info" %}
Bridgable tokens for a specific blockchain are identified by the double arrow icon ⮂. You will only be able to select these tokens for bridging with the selected blockchain.
{% endhint %}

#### Step 2: Select the Destination Blockchain and Token

First, click on the  '**To Asset Selection**'.

![Select Destination Token](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-18 at 12.29.28 PM.png>)

Next, select the **destination blockchain** where you brindge the assets (e.g., Native BTC -> Arbitrum's WBTC).&#x20;

Then, choose the corresponding **destination token** on this chain (e.g., **WBTC Arbitrum ERC-20**).

{% hint style="info" %}
While you need to select the same bridge asset for the swap, **aUSD can still be bridged to USDT or USDC—and back again!**
{% endhint %}

Important to remember, whichever chain you want to bridge to, you will be able to know if its available to bridge or not based on the green highlight shown above.&#x20;

If you do not see the '<mark style="color:orange;">**⮂ ₿**</mark>' icon, it's mean it's not supported / available to bridge to.&#x20;

#### Step 3: Input the Amount to Bridge

Enter the amount of tokens you would like to bridge.&#x20;

You can also use the **Max** button to select your full balance.

If you would like to customize the network fee, you can do it so too as shown above!

#### Step 4: Initiate the Bridge

After confirming the selected blockchains and token amounts, click the **Bridge** button to begin the process.

Before you click Bridge, if you need to check how much the fee breakdown and time required for the bridge, you can scroll down to check as shown below.

#### Step 5: Confirm the Transaction

You will be prompted to confirm the bridging transaction.&#x20;

Review the details, ensure everything is correct, and click Confirm to proceed.

#### Step 6: Confirm Transaction

After you click Confirm, you will be required to confirm the transaction on-chain by clicking "**Confirm**" on the Xverse Review Transaction pop-up page.

### Step 7: Wait for Confirmation

Finally, wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain.&#x20;

The confirmation time can take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, depending on network conditions.&#x20;

Once the transaction is broadcasted, you should see the bridged tokens deposited in your destination wallet.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can monitor your transaction in real time by clicking the **Explorer** page or "<mark style="color:orange;">**1 Pending**</mark>" as shown in the screenshot above.
