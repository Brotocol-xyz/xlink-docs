# What is ALEX?

## ALEX is an open-source DeFi protocol built on [Stacks Blockchain](https://www.stacks.co) and modelled on the worldâ€™s financial markets.

To start, at ALEX you can

* Lend your BTC and earn fixed or variable interest
* Borrow BTC without risk of liquidation
* Mitigate risk with BTC short positions
* Maximize upside with BTC leveraged long positions

Our initial focus \(v1\) is

* Build DeFi primitives targeting developers looking to build ecosystem on Stacks, and
* Simplify the user experience going from\(to\) CeFi to\(from\) DeFi to attract non-developers, broadening the Stacks user base.

alex-v1 implements a number of Clarity smart contracts on the core concept of Yield Tokens \("ayTokens"\). Yield Tokens allow term lending with fixed APY.
