# What is ALEX?

## ALEX is an open-source DeFi protocol built on the [Stacks Blockchain](https://www.stacks.co), modelled on yet extending the worldâ€™s existing financial markets.

Upon launch, at ALEX you can:

* Lend your BTC and earn fixed or variable interest
* Borrow BTC without risk of liquidation
* Mitigate risk with BTC short positions
* Maximize upside with BTC leveraged long positions

Our initial focus \(v1\) is to:

* Build DeFi primitives targeting developers looking to build ecosystem on Stacks, and
* Simplify the user experience going from\(to\) CeFi to\(from\) DeFi to attract non-developers, broadening the Stacks user base.

Alex-v1 implements novel Clarity smart contracts on the core concept of Yield Tokens \("ayTokens"\). Yield Tokens allow term lending with fixed APYs.
