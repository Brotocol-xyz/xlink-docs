## Using the Bridge

Follow these steps to bridge your assets between chains using XLink.

### Step 1: Select the Source Blockchain and Token

To start, choose the blockchain from which you want to bridge your assets (e.g., **Stacks Chain**). Then, select the token you would like to bridge (e.g., **sUSDT**).

### Step 2: Select the Destination Blockchain and Token

Next, select the destination blockchain where you wish to send the assets (e.g., **BNB Chain**). Then, choose the corresponding token on this chain (e.g., **sUSDT ERC-20**).

### Step 6: Complete Transfer (Unwrap)

Once the bridge process begins, scroll down in the **Transfer-to-Unwrap** pop-up and confirm the additional unwrap transaction. This step is required for your tokens to be fully processed on the destination chain.

### Step 7: Wait for Confirmation

Finally, wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain. The confirmation time can take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, depending on network conditions. Once the transaction is broadcasted, you should see the bridged tokens deposited in your destination wallet.
