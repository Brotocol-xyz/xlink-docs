# Integrations

Integration requires a deployment of an endpoint smart contract on the target chain.

For EVM-based chains, such endpoints are currently deployed on [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfd9f795b4c15183bdba83da08da02d5f9536748f) and [BNB Chain](https://bscscan.com/address/0xb3955302e58fffdf2da247e999cd9755f652b13b).

Below is a typical integration process, which can take between 1 and 3 weeks.

1. Endpoint deployment
2. Configuration of endpoint
3. Integration with [Bitcoin Oracle](broken-reference) (which runs validator network)
4. (optional) Wrapped asset deployment
