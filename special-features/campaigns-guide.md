# Campaign Guide

XLink regularly offers campaigns that allow users to earn rewards such as SPARKS, XLink Points, or other tokens by participating in different activities across supported blockchains. These campaigns typically involve tasks such as staking tokens, adding liquidity, or bridging assets between chains.

## How Do XLink Campaigns Work?

In general, XLink campaigns are designed to reward users for interacting with the XLink bridge and its supported networks. Each campaign may have specific requirements, such as using certain tokens, completing transfers, or providing liquidity. However, the basic process for participating in most campaigns usually follows these steps:

### 1. **Register on the Platform**
   - Before participating in any campaign, you will need to register on the appropriate blockchain platform, such as CORE, Mode, or Stacks, depending on the campaign.
   - You can usually find the registration link within the campaign's page on the XLink app.

### 2. **Bridge Assets**
   - Campaigns often require you to bridge assets from one blockchain to another using the XLink bridge. This could involve tokens like aBTC, WBTC, or other supported assets.
   - Make sure to follow the campaignâ€™s specific instructions on which tokens to bridge and where to bridge them.

### 3. **Complete the Required Action**
   - Once your assets are bridged, you may need to perform additional actions such as re-staking tokens, adding liquidity to a pool, or borrowing/supplying tokens on a DeFi platform.

### 4. **Earn Rewards**
   - After completing the necessary steps, you will start earning rewards based on the campaign's structure. Rewards can include SPARKS, XLink Points, or native tokens from the supported blockchain (e.g., MODE Points, ALEX).

## Typical Rewards in XLink Campaigns

XLink campaigns offer a variety of rewards depending on the type of campaign and the blockchain involved. Common rewards include:
- **SPARKS**: Used for various incentives within the ecosystem.
- **XLink Points**: Earned by interacting with the bridge.
- **Blockchain-specific Tokens**: You may also earn tokens specific to the blockchain you are interacting with, such as MODE Points, ALEX, or aBTC.

## Tips for Participating in Campaigns
- **Check Campaign Requirements**: Each campaign may have different requirements, so it's essential to read the campaign details before starting.
- **Stay Updated**: New campaigns are introduced regularly. Keep an eye on the XLink platform or follow community channels like [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xlink) for updates on new opportunities.
- **Plan Your Participation**: Some campaigns may offer better rewards for specific actions (e.g., higher multipliers for staking certain tokens). Plan ahead to maximize your earnings.
